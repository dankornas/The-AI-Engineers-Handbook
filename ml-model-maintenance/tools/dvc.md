# DVC

DVC, short for Data Version Control, is an open-source version control system for data and machine learning models. It allows you to track, version, and share data and machine learning models, and to collaborate with other data scientists and machine learning engineers on your team.

DVC is designed to be simple to use, and can be integrated with a wide range of tools and platforms, including Git, GitHub, and Azure DevOps. It provides a simple command-line interface for managing data and machine learning models, and can be used to automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models.

To use DVC, you will need to install the DVC package, and initialize a DVC repository in your project directory. This allows you to use the DVC command-line interface to manage your data and machine learning models, and to integrate DVC with your existing version control and collaboration workflow.
