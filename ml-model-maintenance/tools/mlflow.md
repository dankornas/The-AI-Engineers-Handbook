# MLFlow

MLFlow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation and training to deployment and management. It provides tools and APIs for tracking, reproducing, and sharing machine learning experiments, and for deploying and managing machine learning models in production.

MLFlow is designed to be easy to use, and can be integrated with a wide range of machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. It provides a simple API for logging and tracking machine learning experiments, and for deploying and managing machine learning models in production.

To use MLFlow, you will need to install the MLFlow package, and integrate it with your machine learning code. This allows you to use MLFlow APIs to log and track your experiments, and to deploy and manage your machine learning models in production.

There are many resources available online that can help you learn more about MLFlow and how to use it. Here are a few resources that you might find helpful:
