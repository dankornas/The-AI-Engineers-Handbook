# Docker

Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows you to package and deploy applications and services in lightweight, portable containers. This makes it easy to run and deploy applications in different environments, without worrying about compatibility issues or conflicting dependencies.

In the context of machine learning, Docker can be used to package and deploy machine learning models as Docker containers, which can be easily deployed to production environments and managed using a model server, such as TensorFlow Serving or Seldon Core.

To use Docker, you will need to install the Docker engine on your machine, and create a Dockerfile that defines the dependencies and configuration of your Docker container. This Dockerfile can then be used to build and run the Docker container, which can be deployed to a production environment using a model server or other deployment platform.

There are many resources available online that can help you learn more about Docker and how to use it. Here are a few resources that you might find helpful:
