# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting platform, designed to monitor and alert on the performance and availability of applications and services. It provides a powerful query language, a flexible data model, and a range of integrations with other systems, making it easy to monitor and alert on a wide range of metrics.

In the context of machine learning, Prometheus can be used to monitor the performance and accuracy of deployed machine learning models, and to alert on any changes or issues with the model. This allows you to ensure that your machine learning models are delivering accurate predictions, and to take action if necessary to improve or update the model.

To use Prometheus, you will need to install and set up a Prometheus server, and configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your machine learning models. This allows you to query and visualize the performance of your models using the Prometheus query language, and to set up alerts to notify you of any changes or issues with the model.
