# Overview

Creating an AI model is only the beginning. There is a lot more work that needs to be done so that the model functions properly with the entire ecosystems when it is added to production. This is where Machine Learning Maintenance start.

Some of the things that we will cover:

## **Model serving and deployment**

* This includes the process of deploying a trained model to a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions on new data. This typically involves packaging the trained model into a container or other deployable format, and deploying it to a server or other infrastructure where it can be accessed by clients.
* This involves using tools and frameworks, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to package and deploy machine learning models to production environments.

## **Model versioning and management**

* This involves managing multiple versions of a model, and ensuring that the correct version is being used in production at all times. This may involve maintaining a version control system, and using tools to automate the deployment and management of multiple model versions.
* This involves using version control systems, such as Git, to track and manage multiple versions of a model, and using tools like Jenkins and CircleCI to automate the deployment of new model versions.

## Model monitoring and evaluation

* This involves monitoring the performance of a deployed model in production, and evaluating its performance on new data. This may involve setting up automatic metrics and alerts to monitor the model's performance, and regularly evaluating the model on a holdout test set or other unseen data.
* This involves using monitoring tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana, to track the performance of deployed models in real time, and using evaluation tools, such as TensorBoard, to evaluate the performance of a model on new data.

## Model maintenance and updates

* This involves regularly updating and improving a deployed model, based on new data or feedback from users. This may involve retraining the model on new data, or fine-tuning its hyperparameters to improve its performance.
* This involves using tools, such as DVC and Pachyderm, to manage the data and code used to train and update a model, and using automation tools, such as Airflow and Luigi, to automate the retraining and updating of a model.
