# Mean squared error

In machine learning, the mean squared error (MSE) is a common evaluation metric for regression tasks. It measures the average of the squares of the errors made by a model in its predictions.

To calculate the mean squared error, the squared differences between the predicted values and the true values are first computed. These squared differences are then averaged to give the mean squared error. The MSE is a more sensitive metric than the mean absolute error (MAE), as it punishes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones.

Here is an example of how to calculate the mean squared error for a set of predictions:

```scss
Copy codetrue_values = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
predicted_values = [8, 18, 19, 26, 32]

squared_errors = [(true - predicted)**2 for true, predicted in zip(true_values, predicted_values)]
mse = sum(squared_errors) / len(squared_errors)

# The mean squared error is 19.2
```

In general, a lower mean squared error indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the true values, and therefore the model is performing better. However, the MSE alone is not always enough to evaluate a model's performance, and other metrics such as the mean absolute error or root mean squared error may also be used.
