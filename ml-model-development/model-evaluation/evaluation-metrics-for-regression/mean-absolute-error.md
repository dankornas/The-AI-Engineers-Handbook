# Mean Absolute Error

In machine learning, the mean absolute error (MAE) is a common evaluation metric for regression tasks. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a model's predictions, without considering their direction.

To calculate the mean absolute error, the absolute differences between the predicted values and the true values are first computed. These absolute differences are then averaged to give the mean absolute error. The MAE is a simple and intuitive metric that is easy to understand and interpret, and it is often used to compare the performance of different models on a given task.

Here is an example of how to calculate the mean absolute error for a set of predictions:

```python
true_values = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
predicted_values = [8, 18, 19, 26, 32]

absolute_errors = [abs(true - predicted) for true, predicted in zip(true_values, predicted_values)]
mae = sum(absolute_errors) / len(absolute_errors)

# The mean absolute error is 4.0
```

In general, a lower mean absolute error indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the true values, and therefore the model is performing better. However, the MAE alone is not always enough to evaluate a model's performance, and other metrics such as mean squared error or root mean squared error may also be used.
