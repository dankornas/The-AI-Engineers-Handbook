# Accuracy

Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, expressed as a percentage. For example, if a model makes 100 predictions and 80 of them are correct, the model's accuracy is 80%.

Accuracy is commonly used to evaluate classification models, which predict the class or category that a given input belongs to. For example, a classification model might predict whether an email is spam or not spam, or whether a customer will churn or not churn. In these cases, accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

Accuracy is a simple and intuitive metric, but it has some limitations. For example, accuracy can be misleading if the classes in the data are imbalanced, meaning that one class is much more common than the others. In this case, a model that always predicts the majority class can have high accuracy, but it may not be very useful in practice.

Therefore, accuracy should be used with caution, and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score should also be considered when evaluating the performance of a machine learning model.

### Example

Here is an example of using accuracy to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model:

Suppose we have a classification model that predicts whether a given customer will churn or not churn. We evaluate the model on a test set of 1000 customers, where 300 of them are churners and 700 are not churners. The model makes the following predictions:

* True churners (customers who actually churned): the model correctly predicts that 250 of them will churn.
* False churners (customers who did not actually churn): the model incorrectly predicts that 50 of them will churn.
* True non-churners (customers who did not actually churn): the model correctly predicts that 650 of them will not churn.
* False non-churners (customers who actually churned): the model incorrectly predicts that 50 of them will not churn.

To calculate the model's accuracy, we first add up the number of correct predictions: 250 + 650 = 900. Then, we divide this number by the total number of predictions (1000) to get the accuracy: 900 / 1000 = 0.9, or 90%.

This means that the model's accuracy is 90%, which indicates that it is making correct predictions in about 90% of the cases. However, we should also consider other metrics, such as precision and recall, to get a more complete picture of the model's performance.
