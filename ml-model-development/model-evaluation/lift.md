# Lift

In machine learning, lift is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a predictive model in identifying positive cases. It is similar to the concept of lift in marketing and sales, but it is applied to the prediction of a binary outcome (e.g. positive or negative) rather than a response to a promotion or offer.

To calculate the lift of a machine learning model, we first need to define what we mean by a positive case and a predicted positive. In a binary classification task, where the model predicts one of two classes (e.g. churn or not churn), a positive case is an instance where the actual class is the positive class (e.g. churn), and a predicted positive is a prediction made by the model that the input belongs to the positive class.

For example, suppose we have a model that predicts whether a customer will churn or not churn. We evaluate the model on a test set of 1000 customers, where 300 of them are churners and 700 are not churners. The model makes the following predictions:

* True churners (customers who actually churned): the model correctly predicts that 250 of them will churn.
* False churners (customers who did not actually churn): the model incorrectly predicts that 50 of them will churn.
* True non-churners (customers who did not actually churn): the model correctly predicts that 650 of them will not churn.
* False non-churners (customers who actually churned): the model incorrectly predicts that 50 of them will not churn.

To calculate the model's lift, we first need to calculate the response rate for the entire population. This is the proportion of positive cases in the data (300 / 1000 = 0.3), or the baseline probability that a customer will churn.

Next, we calculate the response rate for the predicted positive cases. This is the proportion of true positive predictions made by the model (250 / 300 = 0.83), or the predicted probability that a customer will churn given that the model has predicted that they will churn.

Finally, we calculate the lift as the ratio of the response rate for the predicted positive cases to the response rate for the entire population: 0.83 / 0.3 = 2.77. This means that the model is able to identify customers who are 2.77 times more likely to churn than the average customer.

In general, a model with a high lift value is considered to be effective in identifying positive cases. Lift is a useful metric because it allows us to compare the effectiveness of different models, and to measure the impact of a predictive model on the overall response rate.

### Example

Here is an example of how you might calculate the lift of a classification model in Python:

```python
Copy codeimport numpy as np

# Calculate the lift
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

# Calculate the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives
true_positives = sum([1 for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred) if yt == 1 and yp == 1])
false_positives = sum([1 for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred) if yt == 0 and yp == 1])
false_negatives = sum([1 for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred) if yt == 1 and yp == 0])

# Calculate the lift
lift = (true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)) / (true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives))

# Print the lift
print("Lift:", lift)
```

In this code, the `y_true` variable is a list of true labels, and the `y_pred` variable is a list of corresponding predicted labels. The `true_positives`, `false_positives`, and `false_negatives` variables are calculated by counting the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively. The `lift` variable is the calculated lift value, which is the ratio of the true positive rate to the average true positive rate.
