# Recall

Recall is a measure of how well a model is able to accurately predict all of the positive values in a dataset. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions.

Recall is commonly used in classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a binary or categorical value. It is often used in conjunction with the metric precision, which measures the ability of a model to accurately predict positive values.

To calculate recall, we need to first determine the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions. The true positive predictions are the predictions that the model made that were actually positive, while the false negative predictions are the predictions that the model made that were actually positive but were predicted as negative. Then, we divide the number of true positive predictions by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions to get the recall.

Here is a short code example of how to calculate recall in Python:

```python
Copy code# define the true positive predictions
true_positives = [3, 4, 5]

# define the false negative predictions
false_negatives = [1, 2]

# calculate recall
recall = len(true_positives) / (len(true_positives) + len(false_negatives))

# print recall
print(recall)  # output: 0.6
```

In this example, we define the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions. Then, we calculate recall by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions. Finally, we print the recall to the console.
