# F1 Score

The F1 score is a measure of the performance of a classification model. It is calculated by taking the harmonic mean of the precision and recall of the model.

The F1 score is commonly used in classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a binary or categorical value. It is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of a model and for comparing the performance of different models.

To calculate the F1 score, we first need to calculate the precision and recall of the model. Precision is calculated by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false positive predictions. Recall is calculated by dividing the number of true positive predictions by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions. Then, we take the harmonic mean of the precision and recall to get the F1 score.

Here is a short code example of how to calculate the F1 score in Python:

```python
Copy code# define the true positive predictions
true_positives = [3, 4, 5]

# define the false positive predictions
false_positives = [1, 2]

# define the false negative predictions
false_negatives = [1, 2]

# calculate precision
precision = len(true_positives) / (len(true_positives) + len(false_positives))

# calculate recall
recall = len(true_positives) / (len(true_positives) + len(false_negatives))

# calculate F1 score
f1 = 2 * ((precision * recall) / (precision + recall))

# print F1 score
print(f1)  # output: 0.6667
```

In this example, we define the true positive predictions, the false positive predictions, and the false negative predictions. Then, we calculate the precision and recall of the model. Finally, we calculate the F1 score by taking the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, and then print the result to the console.
