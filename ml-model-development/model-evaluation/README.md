# Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model on a given dataset. The goal of model evaluation is to evaluate the model's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data, and to identify any areas where the model may be underperforming.

There are many different methods for evaluating machine learning models, and the appropriate method will depend on the specific task and the type of model being used. Some common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For regression tasks, common evaluation metrics include mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.

Model evaluation is an important step in the machine learning process, as it helps to ensure that the model is performing well and is ready for deployment in real-world applications. It also provides a way to compare the performance of different models, which can be useful for selecting the best model for a given task.
