# Bias & Variance

Bias and variance are two key concepts in machine learning that are related to the performance of a model. Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world phenomenon using a simplified model, while variance refers to the error introduced by the sensitivity of the model to small changes in the data.

In other words, bias reflects the degree to which a model's predictions are systematically different from the true values, while variance reflects the degree to which a model's predictions vary between different datasets. High bias and high variance are both undesirable in a machine learning model, because they can lead to poor performance.

For example, a model with high bias will make predictions that are consistently far from the true values, which can result in underfitting and poor accuracy. On the other hand, a model with high variance will make predictions that vary greatly depending on the specific dataset it is trained on, which can result in overfitting and poor generalization to new data.

Therefore, when building a machine learning model, it is important to find the right balance between bias and variance. This can be achieved through techniques such as regularization and cross-validation, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance.
