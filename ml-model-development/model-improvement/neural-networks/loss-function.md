# Loss Function

A loss function is a mathematical function that is used to compute the difference between the predicted output of a model and the desired output. This difference is also called the error, and the goal of training a machine learning model is to minimize this error. The loss function is a crucial component of a machine learning model, as it provides a way to measure how well the model is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data. By minimizing the loss function, a model can be trained to make more accurate predictions, which in turn can improve the overall performance of the model.

### Example

Here is an example of a simple loss function in Python that computes the mean squared error between the predicted output and the desired output:

```python
import numpy as np

def mean_squared_error(predicted_outputs, desired_outputs):
  return np.mean((predicted_outputs - desired_outputs)**2)
```

To use this function, you would pass in the predicted output of your model and the desired output, and the function would return the mean squared error. This value can then be used to measure the performance of your model and update its parameters in order to reduce the error and improve its predictions.
