# Vanishing / Exploding Gradients

In deep learning, the vanishing gradients problem occurs when the gradients of the weights in the neural network become very small, making it difficult for the network to learn. This can happen when the activation function used in the network is not well-suited to deep networks, such as the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent function.

When the gradients of the weights become very small, the network can become difficult to train because the weight updates made during training will be very small, and the network will not be able to learn effectively. This can lead to poor performance and can make it difficult for the network to learn even simple patterns in the data.

On the other hand, the exploding gradients problem occurs when the gradients of the weights become very large, making it difficult for the network to learn. This can happen when the activation function is not well-suited to deep networks, or when the learning rate is set too high.

When the gradients of the weights become very large, the weight updates made during training will also be very large, and the network may be unable to learn effectively. This can cause the network to diverge and may result in unstable behavior and poor performance.

Overall, vanishing and exploding gradients are problems that can occur in deep learning when the activation function and learning rate are not carefully chosen. These problems can make it difficult for the network to learn effectively, and they can lead to poor performance and unstable behavior.
