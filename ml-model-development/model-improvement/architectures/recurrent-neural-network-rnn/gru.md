# GRU

### What is it?

A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network that uses gating mechanisms to control the flow of information in the network. Like LSTMs, GRUs are designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which is a problem that occurs when training traditional RNNs on long sequences of data. GRUs have a similar structure to LSTMs, but they have fewer parameters and are therefore faster and simpler to train.

### How does it work?

A GRU has two gates, called the update gate and the reset gate, which control the flow of information into and out of the network.

The update gate decides what information to retain from the previous time step, and the reset gate decides what information to forget from the previous time step.

By controlling the flow of information in this way, the GRU is able to selectively retain and use relevant information from the past to inform its current decisions, allowing it to better capture long-term dependencies in the data.

### Example

Here is a simple code example that shows how to use the Keras API to define and train a GRU model for a language modeling task. This code is not meant to be run, but rather to illustrate the key steps involved in using GRUs with Keras.

```python
# Import necessary modules
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, GRU, Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocabulary_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_length))
model.add(GRU(units=hidden_dim))
model.add(Dense(units=vocabulary_size, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=num_epochs)
```

In this code, the `vocabulary_size`, `embedding_dim`, `max_length`, and `hidden_dim` variables are hyperparameters that you can adjust to suit your specific dataset and task. The `x_train` and `y_train` variables are the input and target data that you will use to train the model.
