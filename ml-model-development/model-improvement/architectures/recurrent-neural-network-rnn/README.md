# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that is capable of analyzing sequences of data. This makes them particularly useful for tasks such as natural language processing and speech recognition, where the order of the words in a sentence is important.

RNNs are called "recurrent" because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on the previous computations. This allows them to maintain a sort of "memory" that captures information about the elements that have come before, which is important for accurately predicting the next element in the sequence.

RNNs can be thought of as a type of artificial "brain" that is able to understand and process sequential data. They have been used to great success in a wide range of applications, including machine translation, image captioning, and even music generation.
