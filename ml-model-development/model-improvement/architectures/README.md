# Architectures

Neural network architectures are the specific design patterns used in the construction of neural networks. These architectures determine the number and types of layers in the network, the number of neurons in each layer, and the connections between the neurons.

There are many different neural network architectures, and the choice of architecture can have a significant impact on the performance of the network. Some common neural network architectures include the feedforward network, the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the recurrent neural network (RNN).

The feedforward network is the simplest type of neural network architecture, in which the data flows through the network in only one direction, from the input layer to the output layer. This type of architecture is well-suited to problems such as image classification and regression.

The CNN is a type of neural network that is specifically designed for processing data with a grid-like structure, such as images. In a CNN, the layers are arranged in a hierarchy, with each layer learning to detect increasingly complex patterns in the data.

The RNN is a type of neural network that is specifically designed for processing sequential data, such as text or time series data. In an RNN, the same set of weights is used for all time steps, allowing the network to learn and retain information about the sequence.

Overall, neural network architectures are an important aspect of deep learning, as they determine the structure and function of the network. The choice of architecture can have a significant impact on the performance of the network, so it is an important aspect to consider when designing a neural network.
