# Transformers

### What is it?

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. They are primarily used for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling.

Transformers are based on the concept of self-attention, which allows the network to directly compute the relationships between all input words without the need for RNNs or convolutional layers. This allows transformers to process input sequences in parallel, making them much faster and more efficient than RNNs or CNNs.

### How does it work?

The transformer takes a sequence of input tokens (e.g. words or sub-words in a sentence) and maps each token to a vector representation called an "embedding."

The transformer then applies a self-attention mechanism to compute relationships between the tokens in the input sequence. This allows the model to capture long-term dependencies and contextual information from the input.

The transformer then applies several "feed-forward" layers to transform the self-attended representation into the final output.

### Example

Here is a simple code example that shows how to use the Keras API to define and train a transformer model for a language modeling task. This code is not meant to be run, but rather to illustrate the key steps involved in using transformers with Keras.

```python
# Import necessary modules
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Dense, LayerNormalization
from keras_transformer.attention import MultiHeadSelfAttention

# Define the model
input_tokens = Input(shape=(max_length,), dtype='int32')
x = Embedding(input_dim=vocabulary_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(input_tokens)
x = MultiHeadSelfAttention(num_heads=num_heads, head_size=head_size)(x)
x = LayerNormalization()(x)
x = Dense(units=vocabulary_size, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=input_tokens, outputs=x)

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=num_epochs)
```

In this code, the `vocabulary_size`, `embedding_dim`, `max_length`, `num_heads`, and `head_size` variables are hyperparameters that you can adjust to suit your specific dataset and task. The `x_train` and `y_train` variables are the input and target data that you will use to train the model.
