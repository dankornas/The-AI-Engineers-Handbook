# Q-Learning

### What is it?

Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. It is a model-free algorithm, meaning that it does not rely on a model of the environment to make decisions. Instead, the Q-learning algorithm uses a table of values, known as the Q-table, to determine the best action to take in a given state. The Q-table is updated based on the rewards that the agent receives after taking an action. Over time, the Q-table is refined, and the agent becomes better at choosing actions that will maximize the rewards it receives.

### How does it work?

Q-learning works by learning from experience. The algorithm uses a Q-table to store the reward that the agent expects to receive for taking a particular action in a given state. At each step, the agent chooses the action that will maximize the expected reward, and updates the Q-table based on the actual reward that it receives.

Here is a brief overview of the Q-learning algorithm:

1. Initialize the Q-table with random values.
2. At each step, the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action to take based on the values in the Q-table.
3. The agent takes the chosen action and observes the reward that it receives.
4. The Q-table is updated to reflect the new expected reward for taking the chosen action in the current state.
5. The process is repeated until the agent reaches a terminal state or the maximum number of steps has been reached.

As the agent interacts with the environment, it updates the Q-table to reflect the rewards that it has received. Over time, the Q-table becomes more accurate, and the agent becomes better at choosing actions that will maximize its rewards.
