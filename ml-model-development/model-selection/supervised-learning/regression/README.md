# Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning task, where the goal is to predict a continuous output value. For example, a regression model might be trained on a dataset of housing prices and their corresponding features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.), and then be used to predict the price of a new, unseen house based on its features. The output of a regression model is a continuous value, such as a price or a probability.

In regression, the model is trained to minimize the error or difference between the predicted values and the true values in the training data. This is typically done using a loss function, which measures the error between the predicted and true values, and the model's parameters are updated in a way that reduces the loss. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Regression is a commonly used technique in many fields, including finance, economics, and engineering, where the goal is to predict a continuous quantity based on a set of input features. It is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between different variables, and for making predictions about future events.
