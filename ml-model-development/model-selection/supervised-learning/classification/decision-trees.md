# Decision Trees

### What is it?

A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make predictions based on the data it is given. It is called a "decision tree" because it starts with a root node, which represents the decision to be made, and branches out into different paths, each representing a different possible outcome. Each node in the tree is a decision point, where the algorithm must make a choice based on the data it has seen so far. The algorithm continues making decisions and branching out until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the final prediction made by the algorithm. Decision trees are often used in classification tasks, where the goal is to predict which class a given data point belongs to.

### How does it work?

Suppose you are building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e. stop using your product or service). You have a dataset containing information about each customer, including their age, gender, and whether they have made a purchase in the last month. You want to use a decision tree to make predictions based on this data.

The decision tree might start by looking at the customer's age. If the customer is younger than a certain age, the algorithm would split the data into two subsets: one containing only younger customers, and the other containing customers of all other ages. The algorithm would then repeat this process for each of the subsets, using a different feature to make the next split. For example, it might split the younger customers into two subsets based on their gender, and then split the older customers into two subsets based on whether they have made a purchase in the last month.

This process would continue until the algorithm reaches a leaf node, which represents the final prediction made by the algorithm. In this case, the leaf nodes might contain the labels "churn" and "not churn," indicating whether the customer is likely to churn or not.

So, for example, if the algorithm is given a younger male customer as input, it would start at the root node and follow the path down the tree that corresponds to the age of the customer. It would then follow the path corresponding to the customer's gender, and finally reach a leaf node that contains the label "churn" or "not churn." This would be the predicted outcome of the algorithm.

### Example

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn import tree

# Define the dataset
# The dataset contains information about each customer, including their age, gender, and whether they have made a purchase in the last month
# The possible values for the customer's age are "younger" and "older"
# The possible values for the customer's gender are "male" and "female"
# The possible values for whether the customer has made a purchase in the last month are "yes" and "no"
X = [['younger', 'male', 'yes'],
     ['younger', 'male', 'no'],
     ['younger', 'female', 'yes'],
     ['younger', 'female', 'no'],
     ['older', 'male', 'yes'],
     ['older', 'male', 'no'],
     ['older', 'female', 'yes'],
     ['older', 'female', 'no']]

# The labels represent whether the customer is likely to churn or not, either "churn" or "not churn"
y = ['churn', 'not churn', 'not churn', 'not churn', 'churn', 'churn', 'not churn', 'not churn']

# Create the decision tree model
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model using the dataset
model.fit(X, y)

# Use the trained model to make predictions
predictions = model.predict([['younger', 'male', 'yes']])  # This should predict whether the customer with these features is likely to churn or not

# Print the predicted outcome
print(predictions)
```
