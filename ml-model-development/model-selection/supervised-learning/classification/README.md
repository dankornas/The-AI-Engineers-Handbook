# Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning task, where the goal is to predict a discrete class or label for a given input. For example, a classification model might be trained on a dataset of images and their corresponding labels (e.g., "dog" or "cat"), and then be used to classify new images as either dogs or cats. The output of a classification model is a class or label, such as "dog" or "cat".

In classification, the model is trained to accurately predict the correct class or label for each input in the training data. This is typically done using a loss function, which measures the error between the predicted and true labels, and the model's parameters are updated in a way that reduces the loss. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Classification is a commonly used technique in many fields, including natural language processing and computer vision, where the goal is to automatically classify or categorize data into predefined classes or labels. It is a powerful tool for organizing and understanding large amounts of data, and for making decisions based on that data.
