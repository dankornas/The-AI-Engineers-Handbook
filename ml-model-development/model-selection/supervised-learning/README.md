# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, where the correct output or label is provided for each input.

The goal of supervised learning is for the model to learn a mapping from the input data to the correct output, so that it can make predictions on new, unseen data.&#x20;

For example, a supervised learning model could be trained on a dataset of images and their corresponding labels (e.g., "dog" or "cat"), and then be used to classify new images as either dogs or cats.&#x20;

The model is "supervised" because it is provided with the correct answers (the labels) during training, and its performance can be evaluated on a separate test set.
