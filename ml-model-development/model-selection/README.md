# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that involves giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved by training the computer on a large amount of data, and then allowing it to use what it has learned to make predictions or take actions on new data. In other words, it is a method of teaching a computer to make decisions or take actions based on the data it has been given, rather than following a set of rules or instructions provided by a human. This can be a powerful tool for solving complex problems, and it is being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis.

There are three main categories of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

1. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output or label is provided for each input. The model learns to map the input data to the correct output, and can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
2. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the correct output is not provided. The model must discover the underlying structure or pattern in the data, and can then be used for tasks such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.
3. Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions or take actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward or objective. The model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and can then be used to make optimal decisions in a given situation.
