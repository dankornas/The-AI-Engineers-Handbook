# Welcome to the Journey

The AI Engineer's Handbook is a comprehensive guide to the field of AI engineering, covering the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems.

Written for both experienced AI engineers and those new to the field, the Handbook provides a detailed overview of the key topics and technologies used in AI engineering, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

With practical examples and code samples throughout, the Handbook is an essential resource for anyone looking to learn more about AI engineering, and to gain the skills and knowledge needed to start working with AI systems.

**DISCLAIMER**

You will not become a AI Master for this book. This guide is to help you learn at least the fundamentals that are needed to become a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist or AI Engineer.&#x20;

However, after going through this book, you will have the knowledge to:

* start working on your own projects
* move on to more advanced topics
* be able to start applying to ML jobs (because going through technical interviews also takes practice and after you have gone through a few, you will know what types of questions to expect)
{% endhint %}

So, let's get started!!
