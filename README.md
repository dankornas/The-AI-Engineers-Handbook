# Welcome to the Journey

Welcome to the Machine Learning Challenge!

I have received a lot of interest in my recent Twitter post about crushing the second half of the year by learning Machine Learning and breaking it down the topics to learn each month:

Because a lot of you have been asking for my guidance, I have decided to create a quick guide and break down each topic of each month into particular days.

And because there is tons of information on the internet, you have to just pick one and just start! So, I will be providing learning material straight from the internet FOR FREE!&#x20;

This quick guide is here to help you start your journey as a Machine Learning Engineer.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**DISCLAIMER**

You will not become a Machine Learning Master after these 6 months. This guide is to help you learn at least the fundamentals that are needed to become a Machine Learning Engineer.&#x20;

However, after going through this six month process, you will have the knowledge to:

* start working on your own projects
* move on to more advanced topics
* be able to start applying to ML jobs (because going through technical interviews also takes practice and after you have gone through a few, you will know what types of questions to expect)
{% endhint %}

So, let's get started!!
