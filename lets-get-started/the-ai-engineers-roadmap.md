# The AI Engineer's Roadmap

The AI Engineer's Roadmap is a structured learning program designed to help you develop the skills and knowledge needed to become a successful AI engineer.

The Roadmap is organized into four main modules, each focusing on a different aspect of AI engineering:

1. Programming Skills: In this module, you will learn the fundamental programming concepts and languages used in AI engineering by learning Python.
2. Data Preparation: In this module, you will learn how to prepare and preprocess data for use in machine learning models.
3. ML Model Development: In this module, you will learn about the different types of algorithms as well as how to develop, train, and evaluate machine learning models, using a variety of algorithms and techniques.
4. ML Model Maintenance: In this module, you will learn about deploying, managing, and maintaining machine learning models in production, including techniques for monitoring, evaluating, and updating models over time.

By completing the Roadmap, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts, tools, and techniques used in AI engineering, and be well-prepared to start working with AI systems in a professional setting

**DISCLAIMER**

You will not become a AI Master for this book. This guide is to help you learn at least the fundamentals that are needed to become a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist or AI Engineer.&#x20;

However, after going through this book, you will have the knowledge to:

* start working on your own projects
* move on to more advanced topics
* be able to start applying to ML jobs (because going through technical interviews also takes practice and after you have gone through a few, you will know what types of questions to expect)
