# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for deploying and managing containerized applications and services at scale. It allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of your applications, making it easy to run and manage large-scale, distributed systems.

In the context of machine learning, Kubernetes can be used to manage and deploy machine learning models as Docker containers, using a model server such as TensorFlow Serving or Seldon Core. This allows you to easily scale and manage your machine learning deployments, and to take advantage of Kubernetes features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing.

To use Kubernetes, you will need to install and set up a Kubernetes cluster, and create Kubernetes deployment and service definitions for your machine learning models. These definitions can then be used to deploy and manage your machine learning models in the Kubernetes cluster, using the `kubectl` command-line tool or the Kubernetes API.
