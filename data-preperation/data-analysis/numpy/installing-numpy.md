# Installing Numpy

***

### Installation of NumPy

If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of NumPy is very easy.

Install it using this command:

C:\Users\\_Your Name_>pip install numpy

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has NumPy installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.

### Import NumPy

Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the `import` keyword:

Now NumPy is imported and ready to use.

### NumPy as np

NumPy is usually imported under the `np` alias.

**alias:** In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing.

Create an alias with the `as` keyword while importing:

Now the NumPy package can be referred to as `np` instead of `numpy`.

#### Example

import numpy as np

arr = np.array(\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
