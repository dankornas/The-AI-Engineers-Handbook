## Sort the Result

To arrange the results in ascending or descending order, use the ORDER BY command.

By default, the ORDER BY keyword arranges the results ascending. Use the DESC keyword to sort the results in descending order.

Sort the result alphabetically by name: result:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name"

mycursor.execute(sql)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
```

## Order By DESC

Use the `DESC` keyword to sort the result in a descending order.

Sort the result reverse alphabetically by name:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name DESC"

mycursor.execute(sql)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
```
