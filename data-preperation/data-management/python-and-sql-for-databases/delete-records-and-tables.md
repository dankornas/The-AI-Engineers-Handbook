## Deleting a Record

Using the "DELETE FROM" statement, you can delete records from an existing table.

Delete any record where the address is "Mountain 21":

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = 'Mountain 21'"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) deleted")
```

## Prevent SQL Injection

It is recommended to escape the values of any query, including delete commands.

This is done to avoid SQL injections, a frequent web hacking technique used to destroy or exploit your database. The placeholder `%s` is used by the mysql.connector module to escape values in the delete statement.

Escape values by using the placeholder `%s` method:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = %s"
adr = ("Yellow Garden 2", )

mycursor.execute(sql, adr)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) deleted")
```

## Delete a Table

You can delete an existing table by using the "DROP TABLE" statement.

Delete the table "customers":

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DROP TABLE customers"

mycursor.execute(sql)
```

## Delete a Table ONLY IF it Exists

If the table you intend to delete has previously been deleted or does not exist for any other reason, you can avoid an error by using the IF EXISTS keyword.

Delete the table "customers" if it exists:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  password="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers"

mycursor.execute(sql)
```
