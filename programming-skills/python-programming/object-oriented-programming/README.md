# Object Oriented Programming



Python is a multi-paradigm programming language with Object Oriented support. Everything in Python is an object. Attributes and Behavior are two qualities of an object.

Principles of object-oriented programming system are —

* Class
* Object
* Method
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation

**Class and constructor** — It's the object's blueprint. To define a class in Python, we utilize the class keyword. When a class object is formed, the class constructor is used to assign values to the class's data members.

**Object** — It’s an instantiation of a class.

**Method** — It’s a function that is associated with an object

**Inheritance** — Specifies that the child object inherits all of the parent object's properties and behaviors.

**Polymorphism** — Refers to functions that have the same name but perform different functions.

**Encapsulation** — It is a way to restrict access to methods and variables in Python to avoid direct change of data.
