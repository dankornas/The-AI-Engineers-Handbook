# Python Programming

## **What is Python?**

In the shortest form possible, Python is the following:

* Python is a high-level, multi-purpose, and easy-to-read programming language.
* The interpreter processes Python at runtime. In other words, you do not need to build your software before running it.
* You can directly interface with the interpreter.&#x20;
* It is compatible with a wide range of hardware platforms.
* Python supports both object-oriented and procedural programming styles.
* It may be used as a scripting language or converted to byte-code to develop massive applications.
* It has a straightforward structure and syntax.
* It's an excellent language for beginning programmers.
* The source code is quite simple to maintain.
* It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
* It has a sizeable standard library collection.

## What can you do with Python?

Python is an amazing programming language that has become very popular over the last decade. With python, you can practically do anything:

* Web Development
* Scripting
* Game Development
* CAD Applications
* Embedded Applications

However, the number one most popular application of python would be for AI, which includes:

* Data Engineering&#x20;
* Data Analytics
* Data Science
* Machine Learning/Deep Learning
* MLOps

And this is what we will be focusing on in our AI Engineer's Handbook - utilizing python for AI. But before we get into the awesome stuff with creating ML models, we need to have a solid foundation of how to program in Python.&#x20;

Let's get started!
